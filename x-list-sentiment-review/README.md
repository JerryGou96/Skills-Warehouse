# x-list-sentiment-review

"For X List ticker sentiment, market-session commentary, or collection API comparisons, retrieve sources and report attributed views and coverage limits."

## Installation and usage

Copy this complete directory into your configured OpenClaw skill root. Verify discovery with `openclaw skills check --json`, then request the task described in SKILL.md. Read its branch-specific references before execution. Installation does not install dependencies, enable jobs, change accounts, or grant external-action authorization.

## Dependencies

- OpenClaw browser, web_search and web_fetch
- browser-automation skill and authenticated X browser profile

## Local configuration

Resolve documentation placeholders before use: `RESEARCH_VAULT_ROOT` is your research vault, `OPENCLAW_SKILLS_DIR` your configured shared skill directory, and `DISCORD_READER_RUNTIME` your isolated compatible CLI runtime. These are not bundled settings. Configure vault-relative tracker/archive paths and the QMD collection (source default: `agentbrain`) to match your installation. No vault files are included. Choose your own accounts, channels, lists and output paths. Timezone/language defaults in the procedure can be overridden by the user.

## Validation limits

Static YAML, package, resource-link and privacy checks only. No business workflows, desktop capture, notifications, account modifications or cleanup operations were run for publication.
